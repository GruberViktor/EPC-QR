# EPC-QR for WooCommerce

With this plugin, you can add [EPC-QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPC_QR_code) into your "thank you"-page (the page after checkout). EPC-QR codes can be scanned with banking apps, all the necessary details for the transfer are filled in automatically, and your customer does not have to enter anything anymore, just confirm the payment.
